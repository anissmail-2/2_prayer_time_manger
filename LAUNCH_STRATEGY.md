## Launch Overview

### Launch Goals

**Primary Goals:**
- 🎯 **1,000 downloads** in first week
- ⭐ **4.0+ average rating** after 30 days
- 💬 **50+ reviews** across both platforms
- 📱 **100+ active users** (opened app 3+ times)

**Secondary Goals:**
- 🌍 **Global reach** across 10+ countries
- 🤝 **50+ beta tester conversions** to production
- 📰 **5+ blog/media mentions**
- 🚀 **#1 ranking** for "islamic task manager" search term

### Launch Date Planning

**Recommended Launch Timing:**

**Best Days:**
- **Tuesday-Thursday**: Higher app discovery on these days
- **Mid-month**: Avoid beginning/end of month when users are busier
- **Avoid**: Fridays (low engagement), weekends, major holidays

**Best Time:**
- **9-10 AM EST**: Catches both US morning and Europe afternoon
- **6-7 AM PST**: Allows full day of monitoring

**Islamic Calendar Considerations:**
- **Optimal**: Launch at the beginning of a new Islamic month (fresh start feeling)
- **Avoid**: Last 10 days of Ramadan (users very busy with worship)
- **Good**: First week after Eid (users looking for productivity tools)

**Recommended Launch Date Formula:**
```
Tuesday or Thursday
+ 2nd or 3rd week of the month
+ Not during Ramadan's last 10 days
+ 9 AM EST / 6 AM PST
= Ideal launch window
```

Title: 🚀 I built a productivity app for Muslims - TaskFlow Pro is now live!

Body:
Assalamu alaikum everyone! 👋

After 6 months of development and testing with the community, I'm excited to share that TaskFlow Pro is now available on iOS and Android!

What is it?
A task manager that integrates Islamic prayer times. You can schedule tasks like "30 minutes before Dhuhr" or "after Maghrib", and the app calculates the exact times based on your location.

Key Features:
• Accurate prayer times for 300+ cities
• AI assistant for task suggestions
• Prayer-relative scheduling
• Works 100% offline
• Clean, modern design

Why I built it:
As a Muslim who struggled to balance prayers with a busy schedule, I wanted a tool that treats prayers as first-class citizens, not afterthoughts.

Available here:
• iOS: [App Store link]
• Android: [Play Store link]

It's completely free, and I'd love to hear your feedback! JazakAllahu khairan! 🙏

P.S. - If you find it useful, I'd really appreciate a review on the app stores. It helps others discover it!

5. Improve app based on feedback

**Communication:**
